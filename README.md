# Ponder
Built on top of Spigot, the Ponder API is intended to facilitate the creation and expansion of Spigot plugins. Essentially what Iâ€™m doing here is abstracting out the core functionality of my plugins into a reusable API. It is my hope that this will greatly simplify the process of creating and updating plugins.
