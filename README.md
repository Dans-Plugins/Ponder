# Ponder
Built on top of Spigot, the Ponder API is intended to facilitate the creation and expansion of Spigot plugins. Essentially what Iâ€™m doing here is abstracting out the core functionality of my plugins into a reusable API. It is my hope that by using a shared API, the process of creating and updating plugins will be greatly simplified.
