# Ponder

## Description
Built on top of Spigot, Ponder is a library that facilitates the development of Minecraft plugins through the use of provided tools, services and specifications. Functionality that can be used in many plugins has been abstracted out into a usable framework. This will greatly simplify the process of creating and updating plugins.

A list of features can be found [here](https://github.com/Preponderous-Software/Ponder/wiki/Features).

## Server Software
Ponder was developed on top of the Spigot API. Users may run into trouble using it with other available server softwares like Paper.

## Installation
This API can be used, but is unstable and likely to change. You can download the most recent version here:
https://github.com/Preponderous-Software/Ponder/releases

For help with installation, check out [this page](https://github.com/Preponderous-Software/Ponder/wiki/Configuring-the-API-with-Maven-&-IntelliJ).
